# TBTC.Bot

Bot written in node.js + telegraf.js + firebase functions. Currently at an very early stage of development, so it does not have all the functionality working.

The main idea of this tool is to make a little bit easier life for node runners, help in monitoring and events handeling by notifiing subscribers.
